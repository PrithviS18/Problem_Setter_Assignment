Count how many different strings can be obtained after removing two consequetive characters from the string S, containing lowercase latin letters.

For example, a string "aaba". Removing (first,second)characters gives "ba" and removing (second,third) characters gives "aa", but notice removing
(third,fourth) characters results in "aa" so only two different strings is possible.

Input
The first line of the description of each test case contains an integer n(3≤n≤1e3).
The second line of the description of each test case contains a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

Output
For each test case print one integer — the number of distinct strings that can be obtained by removing two consecutive letters.
