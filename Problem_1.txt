A cake is a non-empty string of digits from 1 to 9.
A good cake is such a cake that it has an even length and
the sum of digits in the first half is equal to the sum of digits in the second half.
You are given N number pieces s1,s2,…,sN. How many pairs ( i , j ) (for 1<= i, j <= N) are there such that si + sj is a  good number? Note that it's possible that i = j.
Here, the ‘+’ operator denotes the concatenation of the two strings. For example, if si is 13, and sj is 37, then si+sj is 1337.

Input
The first line contains a single integer N (1≤N≤2⋅1e5) — the number of cake pieces.

The second line contains N non-empty strings s1,s2,…,sN, each of length at most 5 and consisting only of digits from 1 to 9
.

Output
Print a single integer — the number of pairs (i,j)(for 1≤i,j≤N) such that si+sj is a good cake.
